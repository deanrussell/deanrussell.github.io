Full Bio:
	Hi! I'm Dean Russell. I'm an NPR producer &amp; the assistant director for the show On Point with Tom Ashbrook, where I've been since 2011. I also write about music &amp; technology for WBUR.org.

	I started professionally as a sound designer, film editor & composer. I studied contemporary classical music, writing mostly electroacoustic and acousmatic works. Before that, I practiced the lost art of funk bass and chicka chicka guitar.

	Today, when I'm not producing the news, I'm learning to code. Yo hablo un poco español, también.
